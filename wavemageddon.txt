- we have x columns, we can move vertically freely but no horz
- horz movement happens when we pick up beans or we get pushed back by waves
so we'll have 
MoveColumn(int columns)
- for every can of beans we fill up the gas meter, when it's full we advance
by 1 column
- gas meter needs 5 points to be filled, soda gives 1, milk 2, beans 3
- after the gas meter fills up,
it flashes and the player has limited time before being pushed 1 column forward
- every wave that hits the player moves the player back x columns (wave
size matters)
- waves have 'life bars', each bullet makes the wave smaller (until gone)
- the wave prefab holds sprites of different sizes and is responsible
for updating the wave size

- progression between waves
moar waves
bigger waves
tighter packs of waves
faster waves (windddddddd)
after 10 waves of waves a boss that creates waves, has hit points
doesn't move like waves

- player will have ontrigger

- gamemanger for levels/number of waves passed

4.5 * ratio = camera size
